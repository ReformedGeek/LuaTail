# LuaTail

An attempt to duplicate the functionality of GNU coreutils "tail" utility with Lua

Usage: tail("/path/to/file", number_of_lines_you_want, [stream])

number_of_lines should be a positive integer.
stream, if given, should be a boolean.

This is my first Lua programming attempt, and I welcome your constructive criticism.
